### Introduction

This repository contains code for collecting, working with and cleaning a data set.  The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

### Data Set

The data set used came from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### Execution and files

The Data Set is stored in `UCI HAR Dataset/` directory.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to prepare the tidy data saved as tidy.txt in this repository.

`run_analysis.R` is the script for preparing the tidy data set in this repository. It can be loaded in R/Rstudio and executed without any parameters.

The result of the execution is the creation of the `tidy.txt` file that can be used for later analysis.
